      "chunk :  (0, ' The latest growth figures are slightly more positive than expected by the OBR in the autumn, for this year and the next two. But itâs still a weak growth outlook by long-term standards. Hunt says the OBR are forecasting: 2024: 0.8% growth, up from 0.7% growth expected in November. 2025: 1.9% growth, up from 1.4% growth expected in November. 2026: 2.2% growth, up from 2% growth expected in November. 2027: 1.8% growth, down from 2% growth expected in November. 2028: 1.7% growth, matching the 1.7% growth expected in November. Hunt is still talking about particular regional investments. His list includes measures for Cambridge, to fund a development corporation there. There will be money for transport there. And there is money for north Wales, including money to fund the renovation of Theatre Clwyd. And the government will be purchasing the Wylfa site on Anglesey, where there are plans for a nuclear power station. Hunt is now talking about measures to address historic underinvestment in nations and regions. He announced the north-east trailblazer devolution deal, he says. And he announced devolution plans for Surrey. He says Keir Starmer, as a Surrey boy, ought to welcome this. And then he shoehorns in a rather feeble joke about Peter Mandelson saying yesterday that Starmer should âshed a few poundsâ. If Labour get in, people will be losing more than a few pounds due to their tax plans, he says. Updated at The budget deficit (how much the UK borrows each year to balance the books) falls though the next five years, Hunt says, from 4.2% of GDP in the 2023-24 financial year, to 3.1%, 2.7%, 2.3%, 1.6% and 1.2% by 2028-29. ')\n",

Turning to investment, he says this is the best way to improve productivity. He insists the government record on investment has been strong. In the autumn statement he announced full expensing â making the UKâs tax investment rules the most attractive for any large European economy, he says. He says the government will apply this to leased assets. This change will come in âas soon as itâs affordableâ. There will be Â£200m to extend the recovery loan scheme, he says. And the VAT registration threshold will go up form Â£85,000 to Â£90,000, he says. Updated at The latest estimates for UK national debt show that it will be a little higher than expected in the autumn statement, as a share of the economy, in the next two financial years. But, as Hunt points out, heâs still on track to have debt falling as a share of GDP in five years time, meeting his fiscal rule. Here are the new forecasts for public sector net debt (excluding the Bank of England), as a share of the economy: 2024-25: 91.7% of GDP, compared with 91.6% expected in November. 2025-26: 92.8%, compared with 92.7% expected in November. 2026-27: 93.2%, matching the 93.2% expected in November. 2027-28: 93.2%, matching the 93.2% expected in November. 2028-29: 92.9%, compared with 92.8% expected in November That leaves the chancellor with Â£8.9bn of fiscal headroom to have debt falling at the end of the forecast period â a rather small amount of headroom. Net debt in this Budget looks pretty similar to last time around. ')\n",

He says the OBR expects growth to be 0.8% this year, and 1.9% next year â higher than previously expected. Hunt claims Labour can only implement its energy policy within fiscal rules by raising taxes Hunt is now reading out the debt figures. He says it is on track to fall as a percentage of GDP, meeting the fiscal rules. And the government is also meeting its rule about having borrowing below 3% of GDP early. If Labour decarbonise the electricity grid by 2030, they will not meet these rules, he says. He says Labour claim it will decarbonise in accordance with its fiscal rules. That can only mean tax rises, he says. Updated at Hunt says, on growth, some think there is a trade off between compassion and social responsiblity. He says he does not accept that. It is only because the Tories cut the deficit that they could afford support for people during Covid. He attacks the Liberal Democrats for having no principles, and says he is pleased Ed Davey is in the chamber to hear this. This was a reference to Davey campaign in Huntâs own constituency, which is a Lib Dem target seat. Fuel duty freeze extended Hunt says he will maintain the supposedly âtemporaryâ 5p cut in fuel duty. And he will extend the freeze in fuel duty. Updated at The Treasury says extending the duty freeze until next February will cut costs for breweries, distilleries, restaurants, nightclubs, pubs &amp; bars.

It says: The chancellor is looking to scrap the two-century old concept of domicile, and change when individuals receive the tax break, the Financial Times has been told. The Treasury declined to comment. Non-domiciled people are UK residents deemed to have their permanent home or âdomicileâ outside the country. They can currently earn money from abroad without paying UK tax on this for up to 15 years, provided they do not bring any income or capital gains into the country. Hunt will modernise the system, replacing the concept of domicile in tax with a statutory residence test that would define who benefits from a new system of tax privileges.

Extending the windfall tax is a Labour proposal that the Tories used to dismiss, and, according to a Daily Telegraph story, Douglas Ross, the Scottish Conservative leader, is so angry about the move that colleagues thought he might resign. Ross is MP for Moray, in the north-east of Scotland, and he is worried that the potential impact on the oil and gas industry in Scotland will cost the party votes. In their story, Nick Gutteridge, Dominic Penna and Simon Johnson say Ross had a row with Rishi Sunak about this at a reception on Sunday night. They report: The leader of the Scottish Conservatives had doggedly sought out Mr Sunak across the crowded, stifling room, determined to give him a piece of his mind about the Treasuryâs plans to extend the windfall tax on North Sea oil and gas giants for an extra year. What followed was a âheatedâ discussion between the pair, with Mr Ross warning the move would hammer the Tory vote north of the border and the prime minister countering that it was necessary to deliver a National Insurance cut for millions of workers. A clearly dissatisfied Mr Ross then sought out Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, and delivered a last-ditch plea to him to drop the measure from Wednesdayâs budget. While his demands ultimately fell on deaf ears, they prompted severe unease in Downing Street. No 10 began to fear that their partyâs Scottish leader was planning to resign in protest at the decision â a move that would have gone down well with core Tory voters in Aberdeenshire, but would have been a disastrous display of disunity on budget day. \")\n",

Luckily, this is a task Keir Starmer has been preparing for. In his new biography of Starmer (which is excellent â Iâll write about it at more length on another day), Tom Baldwin quotes Starmer aide Chris Ward as saying that soon after Starmer became an MP in 2015 he started thinking about what he would do on days like today. âWeâd book afternoons out to practise. There would be a budget and Iâd say to him, one day you might have to respond to this, so weâd sit down, go through the Treasuryâs figures together, and work out what he would have done if he had been leader,â Ward told Baldwin. Todayâs budget has been drafted to hobble Labour as much as possible. In a good article for Politico, Esther Webber explains that there is a long history of chancellors acting like this. She says: Glen OâHara, professor of modern history at Oxford Brookes University, points to the gaping trade deficit left for Labour in 1964, when outgoing Tory Chancellor Reginald Maudling infamously left a note for his successor reading: âGood luck, old cock â¦ sorry to leave it in such a mess.â Conservative Chancellor Norman Lamontâs pre-election budget in 1992 introduced a lower rate of income tax which Labour opposed, allowing the Tories to portray them as a âhigh-tax party.â The Tories unexpectedly went on to win the subsequent poll. Jill Rutter, who worked in the Treasury alongside Lamont â and is now part of the UK in a Changing Europe think tank â confirms that âat the time, they all thought they were being super clever in terms of making life difficult for Labour.â She cites more recent examples, too, including former Labour PM Gordon Brownâs introduction of a child poverty target just before the 2010 election â hard for any government not to honor, without appearing monstrous â and Osborneâs own austerity spending cuts ahead of the 2015 election, which proved difficult for Labour to undo without being cast as big spenders.

Jeremy Hunt is obviously in election bribe mode today, but this chart, from the Institute for Fiscal Studies thinktank, which covers fiscal events up to last yearâs autumn statement, suggests that what he is doing is not unprecedented. Denis Healey did something similar before the 1979 election, which Labour lost, and Geoffrey Howe before 1983, which the Tories won. Jeremy Hunt has been talking about âgreat budgetsâ this morning. He did not quite say todayâs would be in the list, but in a video broadcast on X this morning, the chancellor said: Great budgets change history. The bit of history I want to change is to show people it is possible, if we stick to a plan through all the ups and downs, through all the challenges, itâs possible to have healthy growth, good public services, and to bring down taxes. Reminder: the economy is in recession, polls suggest 80% of people think public services are in a fairly bad or very bad state, and at the autumn statement the OBR said taxes as a share of GDP were forecast to reach a postwar high in 2028-29.

They donât always emerge from cabinet smiling like this. Perhaps they were told to look positive, or maybe they were just pleased by what they heard. There has been a lot of commentary (eg here) over the last 24 hours about how cutting national insurance by 2p in the pound is unlikely to help the Tories because they tried that in the autumn statement and their poll ratings have not budged. But, as Stephen Bush points out in his Inside Politics briefing for the Financial Times, this argument ignores an important factor motivating Rishi Sunak. Bush says: So how successful was the 2p tax cut? In terms of the Conservative-Labour battle, not at all. Since the last fiscal statement, the polls have if anything worsened for the Conservative party. ')\n",

But in terms of the internal battle within the Tory party, the national insurance cut has done its job, in that Rishi Sunak is still prime minister. Thatâs the important political context to understand when Hunt will essentially try to do the same thing with a further 2p cut in national insurance. He will also hope that scrapping the ânon-domâ tax regime will cause problems for Labour. On that last aim, he will surely get at least some joy: scrapping the ânon-domâ regime is one of Labourâs few tax rises and it is intended to fund many of their promises. Whatever alternative the party rustles up instead may be unpopular or unworkable or both. As far as the country as a whole is concerned, cutting national insurance did not move the dial in November and I doubt it is going to do so in March. And a Budget that doesnât move the dial may, in the end, fail in its other aim of protecting Sunak from internal revolt. Harriett Baldwin, the Conservative MP who chairs the Commons Treasury committee, told LBC this morning that she âdefinitelyâ wants to see an increase in defence spending in the budget. That is also the view of Conservative party members, according to a survey by the ConservativeHome website published yesterday. It is assumed that Tory members want tax cuts above all, but the survey suggests that 74% of them think higher defence spending is more important. They said Jeremy Hunt should increase the defence budget âeven if it leaves less room for tax cutsâ.

But there are three big questions yet to be answered. First, is a 2p cut in national insurance the main story of the budget, or is there something much bigger to come? The 2p cut is now established as fact, but it is not entirely clear whether that is because the Treasury wanted the news out before the budget, or whether it was just forced into confirming what diligent reporting had uncovered. Budgets normally focus on tax changes taking effect in the budget year. But Rishi Sunak is also on record as wanting to cut income tax eventually to 16p in the pound, and sometimes chancellors announce tax cuts they plan to make a year or more in advance. Will we get some of that today? Second, how will Labour react? Hunt will probably fund his tax cut by lifting two of the four tax increases proposed by Labour (which the Tories used to oppose) and by cutting plans for public spending after the election. Many in the Labour party would love to see Starmer promise to reverse any such cuts when he responds to the budget statement. But Starmer wants to fight the general election on terms set by Labour, not Hunt, and so he is unlikely to leap into such an obvious elephant trap. We might not get the full, considered Labour response today, but we will find out in what direction they are heading. \")\n",

He says he has been transparent about his own â although he does not specifically address the question about a US tax return. Angela Eagle (Lab) ask what part of his economic legacy Sunak is most proud of: the highest tax burden since the second world war, or the slowest pace of household income growth since the Napoleonic war?

Updated at Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, the DUP leader, asks Sunak if he will continue to press the Irish government to continue to do more to investigate crimes that took place during the Troubles in their jurisdiction. Sunak says he has spoken to the taoiseach on this. He says he wants families to get as much information as possible about these crimes. David Davis, the former Brexit secretary, says the government should pay proper compensation, not just to post officer operators who were convicted, but who had to repay money to the Post Office they were wrongly accused of stealing. Sunak backs Davis for his campaigning on this. Stephen Flynn, the SNP leader, says the Conservative party in Scotland is furious about Scotland being taxed to fund a tax cut for England. (See 12.01pm.) Sunak says he wonât comment on the budget. But when he was in Scotland last week, it was clear only the Scottish Conservatives stand up for the energy industry. Flynn says that is not the case. He says up to 100,000 jobs are at risk. Scotlandâs jobs and resources are being lost to help Westminster. Will the PM call an election? Sunak says, if Flynn supports the energy sector, why has the SNP not backed government moves to help it. And he says Scotland is now the high-tax capital of the UK. Updated at Starmer says the ârosy pictureâ Sunak paints of the system is at odds with the lack of confidence women have it. And at Westminster the government has not even allowed a vote on the plan to ban MPs from the estate if they have been accused of sex offences. When will that be allowed? Sunak ignores the question about the vote, but lists other measures the government is taking to help women. Starmer says that claim will be fact checked. He says victims deserve better than this ânonsenseâ. When will the government commit to matching Labourâs plans to tackle violence against women and girls. Sunak says the government has already implemented a rape review plan. ')\n",
      "chunk :  (6, 'Updated at Starmer says this recommendation should be implemented urgently. He asks Sunak to look again at this. The Sarah Everard murder should have been a watershed, he says. But most rape cases do not lead to charges. How can victims have confidence in the system? Sunak says the rape action review plan is showing considerable progress. Sentences for rape have increased by a third, under a power that Labour voted against. Last year there was a 50% increase in rape charges, he says. And he says while Starmer was at the CPS rape convictions fell. Starmer says there is a world of difference between a code, and binding national standards. Wayne Couzens was not sacked even though he had been accused of indecent exposure. All indecent exposure allegations against serving officers should be investigated, as the report recommends. Will this happen immediately? Sunak says indecent exposure is abhorrent. Any officer charged with a sexually motivated crime should be suspended, he says. Updated at Starmer says concerns about police vetting were first raised in 2012. Labour wants mandatory national vetting standards. Why arenât they already in place? Sunak says the college of policing has updated its statutory code. And an entire check againt the national police database has been carried out. Keir Starmer asks about the murder of Sarah Everard. He cannot imagine the pain her relatives are going through. The Angiolini report says there is nothing to stop this happening again, he says. Sunak says this was an appalling case. He says the largest ever screening of officers has been carried out. All recommendations in the report are being considered, he says.

Labour says adopting its plan to abolish non-dom tax status would be 'humiliating U-turn' for Tories Another Labour tax proposal which Jeremy Hunt has lifted for the budget is the plan to abolish non-dom status. The Financial Times has some detail about how Hunt will do this. It says: The chancellor is looking to scrap the two-century old concept of domicile, and change when individuals receive the tax break, the Financial Times has been told. The Treasury declined to comment. Non-domiciled people are UK residents deemed to have their permanent home or âdomicileâ outside the country. \")\n",

He will also encourage wealthy people to bring their foreign-held assets and money to the UK. Tax experts have long complained the current regime is complicated and disincentivises non-doms from bringing wealth into the country, as they are taxed when they do so.

Extending the windfall tax is a Labour proposal that the Tories used to dismiss, and, according to a Daily Telegraph story, Douglas Ross, the Scottish Conservative leader, is so angry about the move that colleagues thought he might resign. Ross is MP for Moray, in the north-east of Scotland, and he is worried that the potential impact on the oil and gas industry in Scotland will cost the party votes. In their story, Nick Gutteridge, Dominic Penna and Simon Johnson say Ross had a row with Rishi Sunak about this at a reception on Sunday night. They report: The leader of the Scottish Conservatives had doggedly sought out Mr Sunak across the crowded, stifling room, determined to give him a piece of his mind about the Treasuryâs plans to extend the windfall tax on North Sea oil and gas giants for an extra year. What followed was a âheatedâ discussion between the pair, with Mr Ross warning the move would hammer the Tory vote north of the border and the prime minister countering that it was necessary to deliver a National Insurance cut for millions of workers. \")\n",
      "chunk :  (9, 'A clearly dissatisfied Mr Ross then sought out Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, and delivered a last-ditch plea to him to drop the measure from Wednesdayâs budget. While his demands ultimately fell on deaf ears, they prompted severe unease in Downing Street. No 10 began to fear that their partyâs Scottish leader was planning to resign in protest at the decision â a move that would have gone down well with core Tory voters in Aberdeenshire, but would have been a disastrous display of disunity on budget day. Normally the shadow chancellor would respond to a Commons statement by the chancellor, but on budget day parliamentary convention means that the leader of the opposition has to do it. Luckily, this is a task Keir Starmer has been preparing for. In his new biography of Starmer (which is excellent â Iâll write about it at more length on another day), Tom Baldwin quotes Starmer aide Chris Ward as saying that soon after Starmer became an MP in 2015 he started thinking about what he would do on days like today. âWeâd book afternoons out to practise. There would be a budget and Iâd say to him, one day you might have to respond to this, so weâd sit down, go through the Treasuryâs figures together, and work out what he would have done if he had been leader,â Ward told Baldwin. Todayâs budget has been drafted to hobble Labour as much as possible. In a good article for Politico, Esther Webber explains that there is a long history of chancellors acting like this. She says: Glen OâHara, professor of modern history at Oxford Brookes University, points to the gaping trade deficit left for Labour in 1964, when outgoing Tory Chancellor Reginald Maudling infamously left a note for his successor reading: âGood luck, old cock â¦ sorry to leave it in such a mess.â Conservative Chancellor Norman Lamontâs pre-election budget in 1992 introduced a lower rate of income tax which Labour opposed, allowing the Tories to portray them as a âhigh-tax party.â The Tories unexpectedly went on to win the subsequent poll. Jill Rutter, who worked in the Treasury alongside Lamont â and is now part of the UK in a Changing Europe think tank â confirms that âat the time, they all thought they were being super clever in terms of making life difficult for Labour.â ')\n",
      "chunk :  (10, 'She cites more recent examples, too, including former Labour PM Gordon Brownâs introduction of a child poverty target just before the 2010 election â hard for any government not to honor, without appearing monstrous â and Osborneâs own austerity spending cuts ahead of the 2015 election, which proved difficult for Labour to undo without being cast as big spenders. Jeremy Hunt has been posing for the traditional budget day photographs outside No 11 with his red box. How taxes go down and up before and after general elections There is a long history of governing parties cutting taxes in budgets just before general elections, and new governments (often from the same party) whacking them up again in the first budget after polling day. Jeremy Hunt is obviously in election bribe mode today, but this chart, from the Institute for Fiscal Studies thinktank, which covers fiscal events up to last yearâs autumn statement, suggests that what he is doing is not unprecedented. Denis Healey did something similar before the 1979 election, which Labour lost, and Geoffrey Howe before 1983, which the Tories won. Jeremy Hunt has been talking about âgreat budgetsâ this morning. He did not quite say todayâs would be in the list, but in a video broadcast on X this morning, the chancellor said: Great budgets change history. The bit of history I want to change is to show people it is possible, if we stick to a plan through all the ups and downs, through all the challenges, itâs possible to have healthy growth, good public services, and to bring down taxes. Reminder: the economy is in recession, polls suggest 80% of people think public services are in a fairly bad or very bad state, and at the autumn statement the OBR said taxes as a share of GDP were forecast to reach a postwar high in 2028-29. Weâre sticking to the plan. pic.twitter.com/kJefyMKndcâ HM Treasury (@hmtreasury) March 6, 2024 Updated at Jeremy Hunt told colleagues what was in the budget at an early morning cabinet meeting, and some of them seemed pretty cheerful as they were photographed on the way out.

      "chunk :  (11, 'There has been a lot of commentary (eg here) over the last 24 hours about how cutting national insurance by 2p in the pound is unlikely to help the Tories because they tried that in the autumn statement and their poll ratings have not budged. But, as Stephen Bush points out in his Inside Politics briefing for the Financial Times, this argument ignores an important factor motivating Rishi Sunak. Bush says: So how successful was the 2p tax cut? In terms of the Conservative-Labour battle, not at all. Since the last fiscal statement, the polls have if anything worsened for the Conservative party. On Monday, polling by Ipsos put Tory support at 20 per cent, the lowest level since its survey began in 1978. The Conservatives have lost three by-elections on the bounce. But in terms of the internal battle within the Tory party, the national insurance cut has done its job, in that Rishi Sunak is still prime minister. Thatâs the important political context to understand when Hunt will essentially try to do the same thing with a further 2p cut in national insurance. He will also hope that scrapping the ânon-domâ tax regime will cause problems for Labour. On that last aim, he will surely get at least some joy: scrapping the ânon-domâ regime is one of Labourâs few tax rises and it is intended to fund many of their promises. Whatever alternative the party rustles up instead may be unpopular or unworkable or both. As far as the country as a whole is concerned, cutting national insurance did not move the dial in November and I doubt it is going to do so in March. And a Budget that doesnât move the dial may, in the end, fail in its other aim of protecting Sunak from internal revolt. Harriett Baldwin, the Conservative MP who chairs the Commons Treasury committee, told LBC this morning that she âdefinitelyâ wants to see an increase in defence spending in the budget. That is also the view of Conservative party members, according to a survey by the ConservativeHome website published yesterday. It is assumed that Tory members want tax cuts above all, but the survey suggests that 74% of them think higher defence spending is more important. They said Jeremy Hunt should increase the defence budget âeven if it leaves less room for tax cutsâ. ')\n",

But there are three big questions yet to be answered. First, is a 2p cut in national insurance the main story of the budget, or is there something much bigger to come? The 2p cut is now established as fact, but it is not entirely clear whether that is because the Treasury wanted the news out before the budget, or whether it was just forced into confirming what diligent reporting had uncovered. Budgets normally focus on tax changes taking effect in the budget year. \")\n",

Will we get some of that today? Second, how will Labour react? Hunt will probably fund his tax cut by lifting two of the four tax increases proposed by Labour (which the Tories used to oppose) and by cutting plans for public spending after the election. Many in the Labour party would love to see Starmer promise to reverse any such cuts when he responds to the budget statement. But Starmer wants to fight the general election on terms set by Labour, not Hunt, and so he is unlikely to leap into such an obvious elephant trap. We might not get the full, considered Labour response today, but we will find out in what direction they are heading.

Not for him Ronald Reaganâs morning in America or Bill Clintonâs place called Hope or Barack Obamaâs yes, we can. Instead only murder, mayhem and total darkness. If only he had still been running things, he lamented, Russia would not have invaded Ukraine, Israel would not have been attacked and Iran would be broke. Now inflation is âdestroying the middle class, itâs destroying everythingâ. âOur cities are being overrun with migrant crime, and thatâs Biden migrant crime,â Trump grimaced. âBut itâs a new category and itâs violent, where theyâll stand in the middle of the street and have fistfights with police officers. And if they did that in their countries from where they came, theyâd be killed instantly. They wouldnât do that. So the world is laughing at us. The world is taking advantage of us.â Read more here: Trumpâs Super Tuesday victory speech: grim visions of an American apocalypse Related: Trumpâs Super Tuesday victory speech: grim visions of an American apocalypse Trump wins Utah in final call of Super Tuesday The AP declared Donald Trump the winner of Utahâs presidential caucuses, the last of the primary races to be called. Long lines and technical difficulties beset the contest. The Salt Lake Tribune reported that: The Republican party had urged caucus attendees to pre register through their website to make the checking process go smoothly. But chaos ensued Tuesday night, after digital systems crashed at multiple caucus locations. At several locations lack of internet slowed down and even stopped the process, leaving attendees stuck in long lines according to one Utah Republican source. It quoted one organiser saying âwhen people come up, either their voter ID doesnât seem to load even though theyâve been voting for a long time, or when we try to look them up by their name and address thatâs not coming up either.â Eventually vote counts began to be released in the early hours, with Trump outperforming Nikki Haley in yet another state. Interactive The victory of Jason Palmer in the Democratic contest in American Samoa was one of few eye-catching moments on Super Tuesday. Palmer, a Maryland resident, said âI found out that I had won because my phone started blowing up with friends and campaign staffers texting me.â Honored to announce my victory in the American Samoa presidential primary.

At the national level, sheâs most interested in Vivek Ramaswamy as a presidential candidate because of his stance on ending financial aid to other countries and locally sheâs voting for Gail Lightfoot, a libertarian running for a US Senate seat. âTheyâre very out there, I look at them as the middle ground,â Tova said. âThey give out-of-the-box thinking. I just donât want the same old same old. I really want someone to make changes.â She also made it a point to research each candidateâs background, upbringing, and prior decisions to weed out those within whom she could have hope from those who were all about one-liners and photo ops. To her disappointment, she found that most candidates, whether they were running for a judgeship, senate seat, or position on the county school board, did not have a website or any other way to learn about their stances and histories. âI had to go on Ballotopedia for most people,â she said. âIf theyâre not doing anything to market and show why someone should want them to represent their area whatâs the point of voting for them?â she said. Polls have closed in Virginia and Vermont These are the first polls to close today, and weâll be keeping a close eye on how quickly the Associated Press will call races here. How California voters are showing support for a Gaza ceasefire One thing weâre keeping an eye on today is the popularity of the âuncommittedâ ballot option in stateâs like Minnesota and Colorado, which pro-Palestinian groups are encouraging as a way to protest Joe Bidenâs support of Israel amid the war in Gaza. But in California, where an uncommitted vote is not an option in the Democratic primaries, voters looking to mark their protest have been unsure what to do. In the Democratic presidential primary, only votes for Biden, the seven official candidates or six certified write-ins will be counted. Write-in votes for âuncommittedâ or âceasefireâ will not count, the secretary of stateâs office has said. Activists are asking supporters to instead cleave the presidential question blank and focus on down-ballot races, including the senate race.
